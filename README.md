I am developing my skills in software development, primarily focusing on C# and SQL Server technologies. During the training I attended, I worked on fundamental algorithms, object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, and developed Windows Forms-based desktop applications using C#.

In addition, I gained hands-on experience with SQL Server, including data modeling, query writing (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.), and performing CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).

I actively use Git and GitHub to document my projects and track my progress. You can view my learning journey and sample projects in this repository:

My primary goal is to further develop my skills in desktop application development and database management, and to pursue a career in this field.

Additionally, I am improving myself in the field of QA (Software Testing) and aiming to build a career as a QA specialist. I also have a basic understanding of Flutter and Dart, and I plan to enhance my skills in mobile app development over time.

I am a responsible, fast-learning, and team-oriented person who is always eager to improve and gain hands-on experience. I continuously work on small projects and share them via my GitHub profile.
